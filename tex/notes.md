## TODO Polynomials:
- Additional Application: quadrature rules?
- Richardson extrapolation? (see Tref, p. 258)
- Examples: p. 19, p.20 of Trefeth book xs
- Example: w(x) = \sum_k 2^{-k} cos(3^k x) is cts but nowhere differentiable
   what is the rate of convergence?

## Nonlinear approximation
- polynomial best approximation, Remez 
- rational approximation by example 
- pade approximation? => exercise...
