## TODO Polynomials:
- Examples: p. 19, p.20 of Trefeth book xs
- Example: w(x) = \sum_k 2^{-k} cos(3^k x) is cts but nowhere differentiable
   what is the rate of convergence?

## Nonlinear approximation
- polynomial best approximation, Remez 
- rational approximation by example 
- pade approximation? => exercise...

% Exam Ideas:
% - Q1: basic facts about Part I
% - Qx: Something about the Fejer Kernel:
%   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fej√©r_kernel
% - spectral differentiation
% - barycentric formula for trig interp
% - some approximation of exp() - since the growth into the complex plane is 
%   very simple
