  abstract  = "This book presents a twenty-first century approach to classical
               polynomial and rational approximation theory. The reader will
               find a strikingly original treatment of the subject, completely
               unlike any of the existing literature on approximation theory,
               with a rich set of both computational and theoretical exercises
               for the classroom. There are many original features that set
               this book apart: the emphasis is on topics close to numerical
               algorithms; every idea is illustrated with Chebfun examples;
               each chapter has an accompanying Matlab file for the reader to
               download; the text focuses on theorems and methods for analytic
               functions; original sources are cited rather than textbooks, and
               each item in the bibliography is accompanied by an editorial
               comment. This textbook is ideal for advanced undergraduates and
               graduate students across all of applied mathematics.",

  author    = "Trefethen, Lloyd N",
  abstract  = "This is the only book on spectral methods built around MATLAB
               programs. Along with finite differences and finite elements,
               spectral methods are one of the three main technologies for
               solving partial differential equations on computers. Since
               spectral methods involve significant linear algebra and graphics
               they are very suitable for the high level programming of MATLAB.
               This hands-on introduction is built around forty short and
               powerful MATLAB programs, which the reader can download from the
               World Wide Web.",

@BOOK{Powell1981-bg,
  title     = "Approximation Theory and Methods",
  author    = "Powell, M J D",
  abstract  = "Most functions that occur in mathematics cannot be used directly
               in computer calculations. Instead they are approximated by
               manageable functions such as polynomials and piecewise
               polynomials. The general theory of the subject and its
               application to polynomial approximation are classical, but
               piecewise polynomials have become far more useful during the
               last twenty years. Thus many important theoretical properties
               have been found recently and many new techniques for the
               automatic calculation of approximations to prescribed accuracy
               have been developed. This book gives a thorough and coherent
               introduction to the theory that is the basis of current
               approximation methods. Professor Powell describes and analyses
               the main techniques of calculation supplying sufficient
               motivation throughout the book to make it accessible to
               scientists and engineers who require approximation methods for
               practical needs. Because the book is based on a course of
               lectures to third-year undergraduates in mathematics at
               Cambridge University, sufficient attention is given to theory to
               make it highly suitable as a mathematical textbook at
               undergraduate or postgraduate level.",

@ARTICLE{Higham2004-fn,
  title     = "The numerical stability of barycentric Lagrange interpolation",
  author    = "Higham, Nicholas J",
  abstract  = "The Lagrange representation of the interpolating polynomial can
               be rewritten in two more computationally attractive forms: a
               modified Lagrange form and a barycentric form. We give an error
               analysis of the evaluation of the interpolating polynomial using
               these two forms. The modified Lagrange formula is shown to be
               backward stable. The barycentric formula has a less favourable
               error analysis, but is forward stable for any set of
               interpolating points with a small Lebesgue constant. Therefore
               the barycentric formula can be significantly less accurate than
               the modified Lagrange formula only for a poor choice of
               interpolating points. This analysis provides further weight to
               the argument of Berrut and Trefethen that barycentric Lagrange
               interpolation should be the polynomial interpolation method of
               choice.",

@ARTICLE{Cohen2013-yj,
  title    = "On the Stability and Accuracy of Least Squares Approximations",
  author   = "Cohen, Albert and Davenport, Mark A and Leviatan, Dany",
  abstract = "We consider the problem of reconstructing an unknown function f
              on a domain X from samples of f at n randomly chosen points with
              respect to a given measure $\rho$X. Given a sequence of linear
              spaces (Vm)m>0 with dim(Vm)=m$\leq$n, we study the least squares
              approximations from the spaces Vm. It is well known that such
              approximations can be inaccurate when m is too close to n, even
              when the samples are noiseless. Our main result provides a
              criterion on m that describes the needed amount of regularization
              to ensure that the least squares method is stable and that its
              accuracy, measured in L2(X,$\rho$X), is comparable to the best
              approximation error of f by elements from Vm. We illustrate this
              criterion for various approximation schemes, such as
              trigonometric polynomials, with $\rho$Xbeing the uniform measure,
              and algebraic polynomials, with $\rho$Xbeing either the uniform
              or Chebyshev measure. For such examples we also prove similar
              stability results using deterministic samples that are equispaced
              with respect to these measures.",
