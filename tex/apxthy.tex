% \begin{exercise}[Piecewise Smooth Functions] \label{exr:trig:pwsmooth}
%   In this exercise we will develop an $L^2$-error estimate for
%   piecewise smooth functions.
%   \begin{enumerate} \ilist
%     \item Let $g(x) := \sin(x/2)$, continued periodically. With a similar
%     argument as in the previous exercise prove that
%       $\|g - \Pi_N g \|_{L^2} \lesssim N^{-1/2}$.
%     %
%     \item Let $f \in C^{p-1}(\TT)$ with $f^(p-1)$ piecewise $C^{\infty}$
%     (technically, $C^{p,1}$ suffices) with finitely many points $\{x_j\}_{j=1}^J
%     \subset (-\pi, \pi]$ where $f^{(p)}$ jumps. Prove that there exist
%     $a_j \in \C$ such that
%     \[
%       f(x) - \sum_{j = 1}^J g(x - x_j) \in C^{p,1}(\TT).
%     \]
%     %
%     \item Deduce that
%     \[
%         \|f - \Pi_N f \|_{L^2} \lesssim N^{-p-1/2}. \qedhere
%     \]
%   \end{enumerate}
